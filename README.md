# App Integration with Google Drive

An app to be published on Google Drive to act as an add-on to 
Google Drive. This app will monitor files that are changed, added, 
deleted, and downloaded on Google Drive, as well as notifying 
individuals whom the user deems necessary to be in the know about 
such events.

### Installing Google Cloud SDK
I followed [this article](https://medium.com/swlh/installing-google-cloud-sdk-to-use-python-from-anaconda-94890014e4e8)
to install Google Cloud SDK for use with Miniconda's python. 
Since I used PyCharm for this project, I had to close and reopen 
PyCharm to fix the issue described in step 4.
